# Go markdown blog
This is my attempt to build a Go based web 'app' and service.
I need a blog and I wanted control over the content (indieweb) 
The blog allows posts to be written in Markdown and allows comments into a MySQL database.

The Blog is being used at http://researchnot.es

The source code here allows for the creation of a markdown based blog built in Go. The programme will include code to support a database comments system, inline and at the end of articles and a database highlights system.

## Issues
See issues for bugs and features I hope to implement.
