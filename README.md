# Go markdown blog
This is my attempt to build a Go based web 'app' and service.
I need a blog and I wanted control over the content (indieweb) 
The blog allows posts to be written in Markdown and allows comments into a MySQL database.

The Blog is being used at http://researchnot.es


## Issues
See issues for features I hope to implement.
